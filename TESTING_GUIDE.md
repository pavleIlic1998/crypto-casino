## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution:** Already fixed! Environment variables are configured.

### Issue: "No active seeds found"
**Solution:** The `init-seeds` function will automatically create seeds on first game attempt.

### Issue: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution:** You started with $100. If you've lost it all, create a new account or add funds via SQL:
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET balance = 100
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Issue: "Game not available"
**Solution:** Verify game_config has all games enabled:
```sql
SELECT game_type, is_active FROM game_config;
```

### Issue: White screen
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors. Already verified no errors exist.

## Database Verification

You can verify the system is working by running these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

### Check registered users:
```sql
SELECT
  up.username,
  up.email,
  up.balance,
  up.created_at
FROM user_profiles up
ORDER BY up.created_at DESC;
```

### Check game activity:
```sql
SELECT
  game_type,
  bet_amount,
  payout_amount,
  is_win,
  created_at
FROM game_bets
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check provably fair seeds:
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  nonce,
  is_active,
  created_at
FROM game_seeds
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
